Jubash: Jubatus Shell
=====================

Jubash is a shell environment to call [Jubatus](http://jubat.us/) APIs from the command line.

As of Jubatus 0.9.4 (released on August 29th, 2016), ``jubash`` is now a part of the official distribution of Jubatus!

``jubash`` is included in ``jubakit`` package maintained by Jubatus Team.
You can install ``jubakit`` package by:

```
$ pip install jubakit
```

``jubash`` bundled with ``jubakit`` works with Jubatus 0.8.0 or later, and is compatible with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.
For more information on ``jubash``, refer to the [Official Jubakit Documentation](http://jubat.us/en/jubakit/).

Jubash for Older Jubatus
------------------------

If you are looking for ``jubash`` that works with older versions of Jubatus, see [Branches](https://github.com/kmaehashi/jubash/branches) section.
``jubatus-x.y.z`` branch points the stable release for Jubatus ``version <= x.y.z``; i.e., you can use ``jubatus-0.4.0`` branch (but not ``jubatus-0.4.2``) for Jubatus 0.4.1.
